# 3Ticks - TPG HackerHouse
**Eliminating black markets**<br><br>

* Ticketing fraud has raised prices and security risks for event organisers. Ticketing bots allow internet buyers to bulk-buy tickets and resell them at premium prices.
* Customers cannot be tracked or exchanged outside of a supplier, and the lack of an exchange system allows secondary market fraud. The event organiser no longer owns a ticket sold on the secondary market. Thus, event organisers are unaware of attendees. Tickets cannot be resold or renamed because they cannot be exchanged on the secondary market.
* Customers buy bogus tickets on websites posing as authorised ticketing agents, losing money and disappointment.
